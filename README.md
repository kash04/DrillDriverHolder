# DrillDriveHolder
Thank you for downloading this set of files to make your own Drill and Driver holder. You’ll find fusion and step archives, as well as dxf (vector) files of each component. This design uses a small amount of 12mm (1/2" baltic birch plywood. I recommend assembling this with Spax brand 1 1/2” MDF+Hardwood T15 self-drilling screws.

This design is free to use and share - both free as in beer and free as in freedom, and we appreciate you crediting us and sharing alike.
